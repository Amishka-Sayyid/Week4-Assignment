**Week 4: Build a Full-Stack Guestbook**

**User Stories**
🐿️ As a user, I’d like to fill out a working form so that I can submit my information effectively and without issues.

🐿️ As a user, I want the application to work as expected on my mobile device so that I can access and use it conveniently on the go.

🐿️ As a developer, I want to create a working API GET route so that I can retrieve data from the server and display it to the users.

🐿️ As a developer, I want to create a working API POST route so that users can send data to the server and store it.

🐿️ As a developer, I want to create and seed a database with dummy data so that I have realistic test data for development purposes.

_Requirements_

    🎯 Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
    🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either media queries or dynamic CSS styling.
    🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.
    🎯 Create a working POST API route in your client.
    🎯 Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.

**Stretch Goals**
🐿️ As a user, I want additional functionality on the form such as form validation so that I can have a more interactive experience when submitting my information.

🐿️ As a user, I want the website to be visually impressive and user-friendly so that it provides a pleasant browsing experience.

🐿️ As a user, I would like to be able to delete posts.

🐿️ As a user, I would like to be able to like messages so I can show my appreciation to other users.

_Stretch Requirements_

    🏹 Provide additional functionality on the form, for example, by adding form validation or other options.

    🏹 Style the page excellently, for example, by adding extra UX
    considerations or animations.

    🏹 Add a delete button to each message and a DELETE route in the server.

    🏹 Create an option for users to like others’ posts.

**Reflection**
_Required_
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

    - i managed the initial requires and for stretch goals i manged to do the media queries for screen with width 400px and 600px.
    *i managed to Style the page excellently, for example, by adding extra UX
    considerations or animations.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

      🏹 Add a delete button to each message and a DELETE route in the server.

      🏹 Create an option for users to like others’ posts.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?/What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

    what i found difficult at 1st was saving the data from the form to the server i was using the url from render.com.later i just used the localhost url and it worked really well and i was able to save the data later i attempted to fetch it (doing this part the previous assignments helped a lot especially the week2 one since i used foreach when extracting single data from the array. atfirst i used the fetch.then and later i managed to use async await to fetch the data).

**Optional**
What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
